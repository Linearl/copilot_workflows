## Three Organization Approaches

### 1. 🎓 Approach 1: Use Standard Templates (4 Pre-built Templates)

Quick start with proven standard templates suitable for common scenarios and standard requirements.

#### Template Selection
| ID | Template Name | Use Case | Key Features | Recommended Users |
|-----|---------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **A** | 🎓 Academic Research | Academic work, research projects | Classify by discipline/project, emphasize version control | Teachers, researchers, students |
| **B** | 💼 Business Office | Enterprise office, project management | Classify by department/project, emphasize collaboration | Enterprise employees, managers |
| **C** | 🏠 Personal Life | Personal documents, life materials | Classify by purpose, simple and easy to use | Personal users, family use |
| **D** | 🔧 User Custom | Multi-role, complex requirements | Flexible structure, custom classification | Multi-role workers, flexible needs |

#### Usage Examples
```
"Please use Template B to organize my work documents according to the business office structure"
"Choose Template A, I need to organize papers and courseware in an academic research manner"
```

### 2. 📁 Approach 2: Reference Folder Analysis (Custom Template)

Automatically analyze well-organized folders and generate custom templates suitable for scenarios with existing references.

#### Workflow
1. **📂 Specify Reference Folder**: Provide a path to a well-organized folder
2. **🔍 Intelligent Analysis**: System automatically analyzes organization logic, directory structure, naming conventions of the reference folder
3. **� Generate Template**: Create new directory structure template based on analysis results
4. **✅ Confirm Application**: User confirms the template is correct before applying to target directory

#### Usage Examples
```
"Reference the D:\Well-organized Project A folder, analyze its structure and generate a similar template to organize E:\New Project Files"
"Use my C:\Personal Library as a template to organize the messy files on the desktop"
```

### 3. 🎨 Approach 3: AI Custom Design (AI Design + Multi-round Confirmation)

AI designs complete organization rules document based on detailed requirement descriptions, supporting multi-round iterative optimization.

#### Workflow
1. **📝 Requirement Description**: User describes personalized organization needs in detail
2. **🤖 AI Analysis & Design**: System analyzes requirements and generates complete organization rules document
3. **📋 Rules Display**: Display detailed document including directory structure, classification rules, naming conventions
4. **🔄 Multi-round Optimization**: Users can provide feedback, supporting multi-round iterative adjustments
5. **✅ Final Confirmation**: Confirm final organization rules document and start application

#### Output Content
- **📁 Directory Structure**: Complete directory hierarchy and naming scheme
- **📋 Classification Rules**: File types and categorization standards for each directory
- **🏷️ Naming Conventions**: Naming agreements for files and folders
- **⚙️ Special Processing**: Processing logic for special files
- **🔄 Duplicate Files**: Customized duplicate file processing strategy

#### Usage Examples
```

"I need to organize G:\My Creative Library with custom requirements:
1. Classify by creation type: novels, poetry, scripts, essays
2. Under each type, classify by status: conceptualizing, creating, completed, published
3. Material files managed separately: inspiration records, character settings, background materials
4. Special requirements: preserve original filenames for handwritten scans, classify reference materials by source
Please generate detailed organization rules document for my confirmation."
```

## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Organization Environment

```powershell
# Create organization task directory and dedicated workflow document
mkdir "organize\[task-name]\{analysis,plan,backup,logs,docs}"
Copy-Item "file-organize-system/file_organize_workflow_template.md" "organize\[task-name]\file_organize_workflow_[task-name].md"

# Copy template files
Copy-Item "file-organize-system\templates\analysis-template.md" "organize\[task-name]\analysis\analysis-report.md"
Copy-Item "file-organize-system\templates\plan-template.md" "organize\[task-name]\plan\organization-plan.md"
```

### Step 2: Launch in VS Code

```powershell
# Open task-specific workflow document
code file_organize_workflow_[task-name].md

# Ensure Copilot Agent mode is enabled
# Use @workspace commands to start session
```

### Step 3: Configure Auto-Trigger (Optional)

You can create a `.copilot-instructions.md` file in your project root to enable automatic workflow triggering:

```markdown
# Copilot File Organization Workflow Instructions

## Auto-Trigger Conditions
When user mentions: file organization, cleanup, directory restructure, file management, project organization
Automatically suggest: "I see you need file organization assistance. Would you like me to start the file organization workflow? I can help you systematically organize files using priority-based, type-based, or timeline-based approaches."

## Workflow Templates
- File Organization Template: `file-organize-system/file_organize_workflow_template.md`
```

4. **Confirm Plan**: Confirm AI-recommended organization methods and strategies
5. **Execute Organization**: Execute according to the selected organization approach

## Environment Setup

### Directory Structure Explanation

Based on the actual file organization workflow template, organization tasks will create the following standardized directory structure:

```
organize/
└── [task-name]/                      # Specific organization task directory
    ├── file_organize_workflow_[task-name].md  # Task-specific workflow document
    ├── analysis/                     # Analysis folder
    │   └── analysis-report.md        # Directory structure analysis, file type statistics report
    ├── plan/                         # Planning folder
    │   └── organization-plan.md      # Detailed execution steps and validation standards
    ├── backup/                       # Backup folder
    │   └── [backup-files]            # Important file security backups
    ├── logs/                         # Logs folder
    │   └── [operation-logs]          # Organization process operation records
