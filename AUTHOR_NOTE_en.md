## üîë Core Workflow Summaries

Each workflow is summarized with the uniform dimensions: Pain Points / Structure & Characteristics / Value / Key Outputs / Boundaries / Quality Controls & Constraints.

### Debug Workflow (debug-system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | Ad-hoc debugging skips steps; scattered notes; weak traceability & review difficulty |
| Structure & Characteristics | "7-step overall" + "6-step loop"; `buglist` partition (to_fix / fixed); per-round directory + templates; explicit pauses: initial understanding / end of round / final archival; experience extraction + indexed archival |
| Value | Faster convergence & traceability; prevents context drift; institutionalizes reusable knowledge |
| Key Outputs | Bug list, round records, stage / summary / lessons / final analysis reports, archival index |
| Boundaries | No automatic root cause detection; does not replace real execution & testing; no guarantee of single-loop resolution |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Pre-change backup; bug state transition requires metadata; cannot skip plan‚Üíanalyze‚Üífix‚Üíexecute‚Üíverify‚Üírecord; next-round goals must be confirmed |

### File Organize Workflow (file-organize-system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | Deep / drifting directory layers; inconsistent naming; duplication & redundancy; missing rollback / validation chain |
| Structure & Characteristics | Three modes: Standard templates / Reverse-derive from reference tree / Multi-round confirmed custom design; flow = Prepare ‚Üí 6-step Execute ‚Üí Summarize; companion scripts: duplicate detection & integrity validation |
| Value | Reduces risk of structural cleanup; produces reusable structural blueprints; ensures safety (backup / validation / rollback) & auditability (logs / plans / reports) |
| Key Outputs | Analysis report, organization plan, backup set, execution logs, summary report, template increments, INDEX update |
| Boundaries | No irreversible destructive actions; "intelligence" limited to counting & structural scanning; custom layouts are proposals requiring user approval |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Modes 2 & 3 require parse‚Üíconfirm closed loops; mandatory backup before execution; explicit duplicate handling rules; only archive after validation passes; templates / rules require explicit confirmation |

### Analysis Workflow (analysis_system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | High initial cognition cost; no quantitative baseline; arbitrary prioritization; no pre-refactor risk map |
| Structure & Characteristics | Three phases: Planning (1.x) ‚Üí 9-step iterative loop ‚Üí Synthesis (3.x); 9 steps: round dir ‚Üí round plan ‚Üí data collection ‚Üí scope shaping ‚Üí deep analysis ‚Üí quantitative evaluation ‚Üí round report ‚Üí recommendations & lessons ‚Üí archival & decision; multi-round progressive; can emit refactor plan draft |
| Value | Builds structured, quantitative quality/risk/indicator baselines; supports refactor prioritization & decision evidence chain |
| Key Outputs | Master plan, round plan/report suite, metrics data, final analysis report, executive summary, improvement roadmap, (optional) refactor plan draft, methodology & lessons docs |
| Boundaries | Does not modify code; does not auto-produce production-ready refactor designs; indicators limited by available data; cannot replace domain semantic judgment |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Phase & round pause gates; reports must cite evidence (paths / metrics); fixed round directory schema; synthesis entry requires coverage + closure conditions; round_plan cannot be skipped |

### Refactor Workflow (refactor_system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | High-risk big-bang rewrites; scope drift; abstraction bloat; missing rollback lineage |
| Structure & Characteristics | Three-level planning (Level1 / Level2 / Level3) + dual loops (Stage O.1-O.7 / Modification I.1-I.6); supports inserted stages (e.g., P0.1); new function list enumerated at Level2‚Üíapproved‚Üíimplemented only if approved; template-driven execution & archival |
| Value | Decomposes refactoring into verifiable minimal increments; constrains opportunistic expansion; captures stage & modification-point experiential assets; enables progressive safety |
| Key Outputs | Master / stage / modification-point plans, implementation logs, modification results, stage summaries, lessons docs, test & verification records, delivery report, tags & archival index |
| Boundaries | No unplanned bulk edits; no generation of unapproved abstractions; does not replace full testing; one stage not expected to cover all latent improvements |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Level2 plan & new function list require approval; Level3 forbids out-of-scope additions; each modification point requires quality validation (tests optional but recommended); plan changes versioned; stage closure requires verify‚Üísummarize‚Üícommit‚Üítag; naming & archival conventions enforced |

### Version Comparison Workflow (version-comparison-system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | Incomplete change awareness due to uneven commit granularity; inefficient manual diff review; lack of modular impact & compatibility lens; unsafe direct workspace switching |
| Structure & Characteristics | 10 steps: Need ‚Üí Parse ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Dedicated doc ‚Üí Env init ‚Üí Dual worktrees ‚Üí Stage1 overview ‚Üí Stage2 modular loop ‚Üí Stage3 docs diff ‚Üí Synthesis; module list derived from diff + user confirmation; layered staged outputs |
| Value | Rapid factual delta baseline; supports high-quality update logs & upgrade guidance; reduces missed breaking changes; accumulates module impact distribution |
| Key Outputs | Commit / file stats, module impact overview, module analysis reports, documentation change log, version comparison report, update log draft, archival index |
| Boundaries | Does not auto-prioritize modules; does not alter business code; no guarantee of commit semantic quality; worktree cleanup requires permission |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Module list & order confirmation; templated module analysis; periodic stage summaries (time/file thresholds); report & log via templates; explicit cleanup confirmation; intermediate stats preserved until synthesis |

## üõ† Building Your Own Workflow (Practical Guidance)

1. Start linear: avoid early deep branching / nested loops.
2. Create the "container template" first, then refine rule blocks.
3. Iterate on a real pain scenario ‚Üí observe AI failure / redundancy / omission ‚Üí reflect improvements back into template.
4. Control density: keep only decision blocks, validation checkpoints, and output surfaces.
5. Introduce heuristics:
   - Delay impulse: e.g., do not optimize implementation before structural scan passes.
   - Double audit: run an anomaly checklist after completion.
   - Rhythm anchors: time/file/phase summaries to prevent context drift.
6. Internalize: promote ad-hoc effective prompts into stable template clauses.

## üìê Template Design Lessons (Key Points)

| Focus | Anti-Pattern | Improvement Strategy |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Too many sections | Model ignores tail content | Tier: Required / Optional / Extended + annotate optional blocks |
| Abstract jargon | Hollow generic output | Replace with concrete measurable dimensions (complexity, coupling, interface changes) |
| Ambiguous directives | Model improvises | Explicit "Do Not" & pause checkpoints |
| Unverified summaries | Slogan-like conclusions | Require evidence references (files / metrics / diffs) |
| No failure path | Stalls on exceptions | Add fallback blocks: degrade strategy / manual intervention guide |

---

## üß™ Making the AI "Think Twice"

- Constrain structure: explicit phase entry/exit & output schema.
- Retrospective slot: per-loop self-check (missing X? drifted?).
- Freeze earlier phases after confirmation: only append "supplement" sections.
- Role shift: inject reviewer persona at critical checkpoints.

## üîç FAQ (Condensed)

| Issue | Consequence | Recommendation |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Over-idealized template | Ritualistic execution | Back-trim using artifacts from a real run |
| Oversized single refactor | Context explosion | Split into staged modular windows |
| Commit granularity chaos | Untraceable change log | Derive commit draft from workflow artifacts |
| Ignored archival | Lost transferable experience | Make archival a mandatory final step |

## üöÄ Potential Future Directions

- Semantic + structural dual-channel version diff classification
- Change risk heatmap (commit frequency √ó coupling)
- Adaptive template thinning (scale-aware pruning)
- Chained workflow orchestration (analysis ‚Üí refactor ‚Üí regression validation)

## üßæ To the Reader

These workflows were not born "perfect"‚Äîthey stabilized through repeated field use. If you struggle with repetitive coordination prompts, scattered analysis notes, or irreproducible refactors, this structured approach may offer a starting lattice. Adapt it to your domain, then feed new heuristics back into templates.

> When proposing a new workflow: write 1-line purpose + 3 core mechanisms + 1 exit criterion before creating directories & templates.
