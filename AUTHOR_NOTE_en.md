## üßæ To Readers

From the initial debug workflow to today's workflow builder, this system has undergone 3 months of real-world refinement. The birth of the **Workflow Builder** marks our transition from "**artisanal**" workflow design to "**industrial production**".

**Our Vision**:
- **Lower barriers**: Enable everyone to design professional-grade workflows
- **Improve efficiency**: Shorten design cycles from manual work to rapid generation
- **Ensure quality**: Guarantee output quality through systematic methodology
- **Promote sharing**: Make good workflow design patterns reusable and shareable

**If you are considering**:
- Standardizing repetitive workflow processes for your team
- Solidifying temporary solutions into reusable systems
- Learning how to systematically design AI collaboration processes
- Deep customization based on existing workflows

**Recommended action path**:
1. **Experience the workflow builder first**: Use it to generate a simple workflow and feel the AI-guided design
2. **Study design patterns deeply**: Read detailed descriptions of 24 design patterns to understand the underlying principles
3. **Participate in improvement**: Feedback and suggestions during use are valuable improvement inputs
4. **Contribute to the ecosystem**: Share your usage experience and contribute new design patterns

**Special thanks** to every user who provided feedback, suggestions, and contributions. Your real-world usage scenarios and problem feedback are the core driving force for the continuous evolution of this system.

> **New workflow design guiding principle**: Before starting to design a new workflow, please first clarify "1-sentence purpose + 3 core mechanisms + 1 exit criterion", then prioritize using the workflow builder for AI-guided design.

## üîë Core Workflow Summaries

Each workflow is summarized with the uniform dimensions: Pain Points / Structure & Characteristics / Value / Key Outputs / Boundaries / Quality Controls & Constraints.

### Debug Workflow (debug-system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | Ad-hoc debugging skips steps; scattered notes; weak traceability & review difficulty |
| Structure & Characteristics | "7-step overall" + "6-step loop"; `buglist` partition (to_fix / fixed); per-round directory + templates; explicit pauses: initial understanding / end of round / final archival; experience extraction + indexed archival |
| Value | Faster convergence & traceability; prevents context drift; institutionalizes reusable knowledge |
| Key Outputs | Bug list, round records, stage / summary / lessons / final analysis reports, archival index |
| Boundaries | No automatic root cause detection; does not replace real execution & testing; no guarantee of single-loop resolution |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Pre-change backup; bug state transition requires metadata; cannot skip plan‚Üíanalyze‚Üífix‚Üíexecute‚Üíverify‚Üírecord; next-round goals must be confirmed |

### File Organize Workflow (file-organize-system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | Deep / drifting directory layers; inconsistent naming; duplication & redundancy; missing rollback / validation chain |
| Structure & Characteristics | Three modes: Standard templates / Reverse-derive from reference tree / Multi-round confirmed custom design; flow = Prepare ‚Üí 6-step Execute ‚Üí Summarize; companion scripts: duplicate detection & integrity validation |
| Value | Reduces risk of structural cleanup; produces reusable structural blueprints; ensures safety (backup / validation / rollback) & auditability (logs / plans / reports) |
| Key Outputs | Analysis report, organization plan, backup set, execution logs, summary report, template increments, INDEX update |
| Boundaries | No irreversible destructive actions; "intelligence" limited to counting & structural scanning; custom layouts are proposals requiring user approval |
| Quality Controls & Constraints | Modes 2 & 3 require parse‚Üíconfirm closed loops; mandatory backup before execution; explicit duplicate handling rules; only archive after validation passes; templates / rules require explicit confirmation |

### Analysis Workflow (analysis_system)

| Dimension | Content |
| --------- | ------- |
| Pain Points | High initial cognition cost; no quantitative baseline; arbitrary prioritization; no pre-refactor risk map |

## üõ† Building Your Own Workflow (Practical Guidance)

1. Start linear: avoid early deep branching / nested loops.
2. Create the "container template" first, then refine rule blocks.
3. Iterate on a real pain scenario ‚Üí observe AI failure / redundancy / omission ‚Üí reflect improvements back into template.
4. Control density: keep only decision blocks, validation checkpoints, and output surfaces.
5. Introduce heuristics:
   - Delay impulse: e.g., do not optimize implementation before structural scan passes.
   - Double audit: run an anomaly checklist after completion.
   - Rhythm anchors: time/file/phase summaries to prevent context drift.
6. Internalize: promote ad-hoc effective prompts into stable template clauses.

## üìê Template Design Lessons (Key Points)

| Focus | Anti-Pattern | Improvement Strategy |
| ----- | ------------ | -------------------- |
| Too many sections | Model ignores tail content | Tier: Required / Optional / Extended + annotate optional blocks |
| Abstract jargon | Hollow generic output | Replace with concrete measurable dimensions (complexity, coupling, interface changes) |
| Ambiguous directives | Model improvises | Explicit "Do Not" & pause checkpoints |
| Unverified summaries | Slogan-like conclusions | Require evidence references (files / metrics / diffs) |
| No failure path | Stalls on exceptions | Add fallback blocks: degrade strategy / manual intervention guide |

---

## üß™ Making the AI "Think Twice"

- Constrain structure: explicit phase entry/exit & output schema.
- Retrospective slot: per-loop self-check (missing X? drifted?).
- Freeze earlier phases after confirmation: only append "supplement" sections.
- Role shift: inject reviewer persona at critical checkpoints.

## üîç FAQ (Condensed)

| Issue | Consequence | Recommendation |
| ----- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Over-idealized template | Ritualistic execution | Back-trim using artifacts from a real run |
| Oversized single refactor | Context explosion | Split into staged modular windows |
| Commit granularity chaos | Untraceable change log | Derive commit draft from workflow artifacts |
| Ignored archival | Lost transferable experience | Make archival a mandatory final step |

---

## üöÄ Potential Future Directions

- Semantic + structural dual-channel version diff classification
- Change risk heatmap (commit frequency √ó coupling)
- Adaptive template thinning (scale-aware pruning)
- Chained workflow orchestration (analysis ‚Üí refactor ‚Üí regression validation)

## üßæ To the Reader

These workflows were not born "perfect"‚Äîthey stabilized through repeated field use. If you struggle with repetitive coordination prompts, scattered analysis notes, or irreproducible refactors, this structured approach may offer a starting lattice. Adapt it to your domain, then feed new heuristics back into templates.

> When proposing a new workflow: write 1-line purpose + 3 core mechanisms + 1 exit criterion before creating directories & templates.
