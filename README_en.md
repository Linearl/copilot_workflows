# Copilot Workflow System

> üåç **Language Versions**: [English](README_en.md) | [‰∏≠Êñá](README.md)

A comprehensive workflow system based on GitHub Copilot for systematic debugging, file organization, code analysis, refactoring, and version comparison.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

> **"Process as Tool, Tool as Leverage"**

*"New tools are not extensions of old methods, but declarations of new possibilities."* ‚Äî Kevin Kelly

The essence of tools is **"reusable leverage"**, while processes are **"industrialized packaging of tools"**. As Kevin Kelly observed, *"The greatest invention of the past 200 years was not any specific tool, but the scientific method itself‚Äîa process that reliably produces innovation."*

This system embodies this philosophy by transforming debugging, file organization, code analysis, and refactoring from ad-hoc activities into **systematic, replicable processes** that serve as powerful leverage tools for AI-assisted development.

**üí° Extend and Customize**: You can leverage these existing workflows as templates to develop your own specialized workflows with Copilot's assistance, then iteratively optimize them through practice.

## üöÄ Why Use Workflows

### üéØ Enhanced Focus and Context Management

Workflows have been extensively tested and optimized to help AI models maintain focus on objectives and automatically preserve context during complex task execution. This structured approach prevents AI from losing track of the original goals while navigating through multi-step processes.

### üí∞ Optimized Request Efficiency

Using workflows can significantly reduce the number of interactions with Copilot, enabling single requests to accomplish more comprehensive work. This efficiency translates directly into cost savings by reducing the consumption of premium request quotas.

### üîÑ Systematic Reproducibility

Workflows ensure consistent results across different sessions and users, transforming ad-hoc problem-solving into reliable, repeatable processes that can be refined and improved over time.

## üéØ Core Workflows

The system provides five primary workflows designed for AI-assisted development:

### 1. Debug Workflow

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Linearl/copilot_workflows.git
cd copilot_workflows
```

### 2. Enable Copilot Agent Mode

Configure your VS Code Copilot to use agent mode for optimal workflow support.

### 3. Choose Your Approach

You can use workflows in two ways:

## ‚ö° Option A: Manual Workflow

### 3A. Direct Template Usage

Open the appropriate workflow template in VS Code:

```bash
# For debugging tasks
code debug-system/debug_workflow_template.md

# For file organization tasks
code file-organize-system/file_organize_workflow_template.md

# For code analysis tasks
code analysis_system/analysis_workflow_template.md

# For refactor tasks
code refactor_system/refactor_workflow_template.md
```

> **üìù Note**: These are template files. The actual workflow documents will be automatically generated when you start the workflow process.

### 4A. Natural Language Interaction

Simply describe your problem or task in natural language - the workflow will handle the parsing and formatting automatically.

## ‚ö° Option B: Auto-Trigger Workflow

### 3B. Configure Auto-Trigger

#### Step 1: Create Instructions File

Create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your project to enable automatic workflow triggering:

#### Step 2: Configure VS Code Settings

Add the following configuration to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
    {"file": ".github/copilot-instructions.md"}
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Instructions File Content

```markdown
# Copilot Workflow Instructions

## Auto-Trigger Conditions

### For Debug Workflow
When user mentions: debugging, error fixing, troubleshooting, bug resolution, code issues
Automatically suggest: "I notice you're working on debugging. Would you like me to start the systematic debug workflow? I can create a structured debugging session document to help organize the troubleshooting process."

### For File Organization Workflow
When user mentions: file organization, cleanup, directory restructure, file management, project organization
Automatically suggest: "I see you need file organization assistance. Would you like me to start the file organization workflow? I can help you systematically organize files using priority-based, type-based, or timeline-based approaches."

### For Analysis Workflow
When user mentions: code analysis, code quality, performance optimization, technical debt, refactoring, architecture review
Automatically suggest: "I see you need code analysis assistance. Would you like me to start the analysis workflow? I can help you systematically analyze code quality, identify technical debt, and provide optimization recommendations."

### For Refactor Workflow
When user mentions: code refactoring, system refactoring, architecture improvement, code restructuring, refactor plan
Automatically suggest: "I see you need code refactoring assistance. Would you like me to start the refactor workflow? I can help you develop systematic refactoring plans based on analysis results and safely execute refactoring tasks."

### For Version Comparison Workflow
When user mentions: version comparison, diff analysis, change tracking, version control, git diff
Automatically suggest: "I see you need version comparison assistance. Would you like me to start the version comparison workflow? I can help you systematically analyze differences between code versions, track changes, and generate comprehensive reports."
